# 👥 Team Lead Onboarding Checklist\n\n## 🎯 **Ensuring Developer Readiness**\n\nUse this checklist to verify each developer is properly prepared before they start coding.\n\n---\n\n## 📋 **Pre-Development Verification**\n\n### **For Each New Developer:**\n\n#### **📚 Documentation Review**\n- [ ] Developer has read `CUSTOM_USER_ALERT.md`\n- [ ] Developer has read `DEVELOPER_ONBOARDING.md`\n- [ ] Developer has read `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`\n- [ ] Developer has read `apps/accounts/README.md`\n- [ ] Developer understands the custom User model implications\n\n#### **🛠️ Technical Setup**\n- [ ] Developer can run the project locally\n- [ ] Developer can access the admin panel\n- [ ] Developer can access the dashboard (`/review/`)\n- [ ] Developer has run all tests successfully: `python manage.py test`\n- [ ] Developer has created sample data: `python manage.py create_sample_sessions`\n\n#### **🧪 Knowledge Verification**\n- [ ] Developer can explain why we use `get_user_model()`\n- [ ] Developer can explain what `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` is for\n- [ ] Developer knows where to find working examples (`review_manager`)\n- [ ] Developer knows the correct pattern for model ForeignKeys\n- [ ] Developer understands the error symptoms of wrong User model usage\n\n#### **🔍 Code Review**\n- [ ] Developer has studied `apps/review_manager/models.py`\n- [ ] Developer has studied `apps/review_manager/views.py`\n- [ ] Developer has studied `apps/review_manager/tests.py`\n- [ ] Developer understands the app structure and patterns\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 **Warning Signs to Watch For**\n\n### **Red Flags in Code Reviews:**\n- ❌ `from django.contrib.auth.models import User`\n- ❌ Direct `User` references in models without `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL`\n- ❌ Test failures related to User model\n- ❌ Hardcoded `auth.User` anywhere in code\n- ❌ Migration errors mentioning User model conflicts\n\n### **Red Flags in Developer Questions:**\n- \"Why can't I import User directly?\"\n- \"What's wrong with django.contrib.auth.models.User?\"\n- \"Why are my tests failing with User model errors?\"\n- \"What is get_user_model() for?\"\n\n**If you see these signs:** Stop development and re-review the documentation.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **Verification Tests**\n\n### **Quick Developer Test (5 minutes):**\n\n**Ask the developer to:**\n1. Show you the correct way to import User model\n2. Show you the correct way to create a ForeignKey to User\n3. Show you how to create a user in a test\n4. Explain what happens if they use the wrong User model\n5. Show you where to find working examples\n\n**Expected Answers:**\n```python\n# 1. Correct import\nfrom django.contrib.auth import get_user_model\nUser = get_user_model()\n\n# 2. Correct ForeignKey\nuser = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\n# 3. Correct test user creation\nself.user = User.objects.create_user(username='test', password='pass')\n\n# 4. Error symptoms\n\"Manager isn't available; 'auth.User' has been swapped for 'accounts.User'\"\n\n# 5. Working examples\napps/review_manager/ - fully implemented reference\n```\n\n---\n\n## 📊 **Team Readiness Dashboard**\n\n### **Track Each Developer:**\n\n| Developer | Docs Read | Setup Complete | Tests Pass | Knowledge Check | Ready to Code |\n|-----------|-----------|----------------|------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Dev 1     | ✅        | ✅             | ✅         | ✅              | ✅            |\n| Dev 2     | ❌        | ❌             | ❌         | ❌              | ❌            |\n| Dev 3     | ✅        | ✅             | ❌         | ❌              | ❌            |\n\n### **Team Metrics:**\n- **Onboarded Developers:** X / Y\n- **Developers Ready to Code:** X / Y\n- **Average Onboarding Time:** X hours\n- **Common Issues:** List top 3 issues encountered\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 **Ongoing Monitoring**\n\n### **Code Review Standards:**\n- Every PR must be reviewed for User model compliance\n- Use the git pre-commit hook to catch common issues\n- Flag any User model related code for extra scrutiny\n- Ensure tests are updated with correct patterns\n\n### **Regular Check-ins:**\n- Weekly team standup: Any User model related issues?\n- Sprint retrospectives: User model confusion points?\n- New feature planning: User model impact assessment?\n\n---\n\n## 🆘 **Emergency Procedures**\n\n### **If a Developer Commits Wrong User Model Code:**\n1. **Stop deployment** immediately\n2. **Revert commit** if possible\n3. **Review impact** on database migrations\n4. **Re-onboard developer** with documentation\n5. **Update team** on what happened and how to prevent\n\n### **Prevention Strategies:**\n- Make documentation review mandatory\n- Use automated checks (pre-commit hooks)\n- Pair programming for User model related code\n- Regular architecture review sessions\n\n---\n\n## 📞 **Escalation Contacts**\n\n- **Architecture Questions:** Project Lead\n- **Django User Model Issues:** Senior Django Developer\n- **Database Migration Problems:** Database Administrator\n- **Testing Issues:** QA Lead\n\n---\n\n**🎯 Goal: Zero User model related bugs in production!**\n\n**📝 Remember to update this checklist as the team learns and grows.**\n
