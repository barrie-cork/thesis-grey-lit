# Project File Structure

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

This document outlines the file and directory structure of the Thesis Grey project. Its purpose is to provide a clear map for developers, ensuring consistency in organization and helping to quickly locate relevant parts of the codebase. This document should be updated as the project evolves.

## 2. High-Level Directory Structure

- **`/` (Root Directory):** Contains the main project files and top-level directories.
  - `apps/`: Houses individual Django applications (modules) of the project.
  - `docs/`: Contains project documentation, including this file and task lists.
  - `scripts/`: Utility scripts for development, deployment, or other tasks.
  - `static/` (Conceptual/Empty for now): For project-wide static files. If used, add to `STATICFILES_DIRS`.
  - `tasks/`: Potentially for task definitions or related files (e.g., Celery tasks if not within apps).
  - `templates/`: Holds project-wide HTML templates, notably `base.html`.
  - `thesis_grey_project/`: The Django project configuration directory.
  - `.env`: Environment variables (local, not committed).
  - `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
  - `docker-compose.yml`: Defines and configures multi-container Docker applications.
  - `manage.py`: Django's command-line utility for administrative tasks.
  - `README.md`: Main project README providing an overview, setup, and usage instructions.
  - `requirements.txt`: Lists project dependencies.

## 3. Detailed App Structure (`apps/`)

This section will detail the structure of each Django app within the `apps/` directory. A typical app follows this pattern:

- `__init__.py`: Makes the directory a Python package.
- `admin.py`: Django admin interface configuration for the app's models.
- `apps.py`: Application configuration for the app.
- `forms.py`: Custom forms used by the app.
- `models.py`: Defines the database models for the app.
- `urls.py`: URL routing specific to the app.
- `views.py`: Handles the logic for the app's views.
- `tests.py`: Contains tests for the app.
- `templates/<app_name>/`: Contains HTML templates specific to this app.
- `static/<app_name>/` (Optional): For static files (CSS, JS, images) specific to this app.
- `migrations/`: Database migration files generated by Django.

### 3.1 `apps/accounts/`

Controls user authentication, registration, profile management, and related functionalities. (See map for detailed file list).

### 3.2 `apps/reporting/`

(Purpose: Handles generation and display of reports.)

### 3.3 `apps/review_manager/`

(Purpose: Manages literature review sessions, projects, etc.)

### 3.4 `apps/review_results/`

(Purpose: Manages and displays the results of literature reviews.)

### 3.5 `apps/results_manager/`

(Purpose: Likely related to managing processed results from searches or reviews.)

### 3.6 `apps/search_strategy/`

(Purpose: Manages and executes search strategies for literature discovery.)

### 3.7 `apps/serp_execution/`

(Purpose: Handles the execution of Search Engine Results Page (SERP) queries and data retrieval.)

*(For each app, specific files like `forms.py`, `urls.py`, `templates/`, `static/` will exist as needed.)*

## 4. Project Configuration (`thesis_grey_project/`)

This directory contains the core Django project settings and configurations.

- `__init__.py`: Makes the directory a Python package.
- `asgi.py`: Configuration for ASGI-compatible web servers (for asynchronous features).
- `settings/`: Directory containing settings files.
  - `__init__.py`: Makes `settings` a package.
  - `base.py`: Base settings applicable to all environments.
  - `local.py`: Settings for local development (overrides/extends `base.py`).
  - `production.py`: Settings for the production environment (overrides/extends `base.py`).
- `urls.py`: Root URL configuration for the entire project. Includes URLs from individual apps.
- `wsgi.py`: Configuration for WSGI-compatible web servers.

## 5. Templates (`templates/`)

This directory at the project root holds global HTML templates.

- `base.html`: The main site-wide base template. Other app-specific templates should extend this.
- Other global templates (e.g., `404.html`, `500.html`) can be added here.

## 6. Static Files (`static/`)

- Project-level static files can be placed in `/static/` at the project root (ensure this path is in `STATICFILES_DIRS` in settings). It is currently empty.
- App-specific static files reside within each app, e.g., `apps/accounts/static/accounts/css/`.

## 7. Documentation (`docs/`)

Contains all project-related documentation.

- `file_structure.md`: This document.
- `tasks-auth-implementation.md`: Task list and notes for the authentication feature.
