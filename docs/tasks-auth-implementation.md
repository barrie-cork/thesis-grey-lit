# Authentication Feature - Implementation Task List

**Feature:** Authentication System  
**Based on:** PRD-auth.md  
**Created:** 2025-01-03  
**Status:** In Progress (Core auth backend complete, frontend templates in progress)

## 🎯 Overview

This task list breaks down the authentication feature implementation into manageable, sequential tasks following Django best practices and the requirements specified in PRD-auth.md.

**Developer Notes (Current Status & Next Steps):**
*   Core authentication backend (views, forms for signup, login, profile, password reset) is largely implemented.
*   Email configuration with console backend is working for password reset.
*   Base template has been consolidated to `templates/base.html`.
*   Next immediate steps involve completing the `signup.html` and `profile.html` templates, then moving to static files/styling (Phase 7) and testing (Phase 10).
*   The `file_structure.md` document is being created to provide an overview of the project layout.
