# Review Manager Code Comments Documentation

This document provides comprehensive explanations of the key code components in the Review Manager app.

## Core Architecture Patterns

### 1. Model Layer (`models.py`)

#### SearchSession Model
The SearchSession model is the central entity of the review manager:

```python
class SearchSession(models.Model):
    """
    Core model representing a systematic literature review session.
    
    WORKFLOW STATES:
    - draft: Initial creation, can be freely edited/deleted
    - strategy_ready: Search strategy defined, ready for execution
    - executing: Background search in progress (SERP execution)
    - processing: Results being processed and deduplicated
    - ready_for_review: Results ready for manual review
    - in_review: Active review process ongoing
    - completed: Review finished, can be archived
    - failed: Error state with recovery options
    - archived: Long-term storage, hidden from active views
    
    SECURITY MODEL:
    - UUID primary keys for security and compatibility
    - User ownership enforced at database and view levels
    - Status-based permissions for state-sensitive operations
    
    PHASE 2 PREPARATION:
    - Visibility field for team collaboration (unused in Phase 1)
    - Team-related fields stubbed for future expansion
    """
```

#### Activity Logging System
```python
class SessionActivity(models.Model):
    """
    Comprehensive audit trail for all session changes.
    
    AUTO-LOGGING VIA SIGNALS:
    - Model changes trigger automatic activity creation
    - Status transitions logged with detailed metadata
    - User actions tracked with IP address and context
    
    MANUAL LOGGING FOR BUSINESS EVENTS:
    - Strategy completion, review milestones
    - Error recovery actions and system events
    - User comments and workflow checkpoints
    
    JSON DETAILS FIELD:
    - Stores structured metadata about each activity
    - UUID-safe serialization via custom encoder
    - Searchable and filterable for analytics
    """
```

### 2. View Layer Patterns

#### Ownership Validation Pattern
```python
class SessionOwnershipMixin:
    """
    Enforces session ownership across all views.
    
    SECURITY PRINCIPLE:
    Users can only access sessions they created. This is enforced
    at the database query level (filter by created_by) and at the
    object level (get_object checks ownership).
    
    IMPLEMENTATION:
    - get_queryset(): Filters to user's sessions only
    - get_object(): Validates ownership or returns 404
    - Prevents data leakage even with UUID guessing
    """
    
    def get_queryset(self):
        # SECURITY: Only return sessions owned by current user
        return super().get_queryset().filter(created_by=self.request.user)
    
    def get_object(self, queryset=None):
        # SECURITY: Ownership validation with 404 on unauthorized access
        obj = super().get_object(queryset)
        if obj.created_by != self.request.user:
            raise Http404("Session not found")
        return obj
```

#### Smart Navigation System
```python
class SessionNavigationMixin:
    """
    Context-aware navigation based on session status.
    
    BUSINESS LOGIC:
    Each session status has a "next logical step" that users
    should take. This mixin calculates the appropriate URL
    and provides helpful context for user guidance.
    
    FUTURE-PROOFING:
    Uses safe_reverse() to handle URLs for apps that don't
    exist yet (search_strategy, serp_execution, etc.).
    Falls back gracefully to session detail view.
    
    STATUS TRANSITIONS:
    - draft → define search strategy
    - strategy_ready → execute searches  
    - executing → monitor progress
    - processing → wait for completion
    - ready_for_review → start reviewing results
    - in_review → continue review process
    - completed → view final report
    - failed → see error details and recovery options
    - archived → view archived report
    """
```

#### Dashboard Query Optimization
```python
class DashboardView(ListView):
    """
    High-performance dashboard with advanced filtering.
    
    PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
    - select_related('created_by'): Prevents N+1 queries
    - Strategic ordering by status priority
    - Pagination (12 items) for consistent load times
    - Database-level filtering reduces memory usage
    
    FILTERING CAPABILITIES:
    - Status: all, active, draft, completed, archived, failed
    - Search: Title and description full-text search
    - Date range: today, week, month, year
    - Sorting: status (priority), created, updated, title
    
    STATUS PRIORITY ORDERING:
    Uses Django's Case/When for database-level sorting:
    1. in_review (highest priority - active work)
    2. ready_for_review (ready for action)
    3. processing (automatic, but worth monitoring)
    4. executing (automatic, but worth monitoring)  
    5. strategy_ready (ready for execution)
    6. draft (new sessions needing attention)
    7. failed (error state needing resolution)
    8. completed (finished work)
    9. archived (lowest priority - stored)
    """
```

### 3. Form Layer Security

#### Server-side Validation
```python
class SessionCreateForm(forms.ModelForm):
    """
    Secure form with comprehensive validation.
    
    VALIDATION LAYERS:
    1. Client-side: HTML5 validation and JavaScript
    2. Server-side: Django form validation
    3. Model-level: Database constraints
    4. Business logic: Custom clean methods
    
    SECURITY MEASURES:
    - CSRF protection required
    - Input sanitization for XSS prevention
    - Length limits enforced server-side
    - User ownership automatically assigned
    
    AUDIT TRAIL:
    Form save() method automatically creates activity
    log entry for session creation with user context.
    """
    
    def clean_description(self):
        """
        Server-side validation for description field.
        
        NOTE: Client-side maxlength can be bypassed, so we
        enforce the limit here. This prevents database errors
        and ensures data consistency.
        """
        description = self.cleaned_data.get('description', '')
        if len(description) > 1000:
            raise ValidationError('Description cannot be longer than 1000 characters.')
        return description
```

### 4. Signal-based Activity Logging

#### Automatic Change Tracking
```python
class StatusChangeSignalHandler:
    """
    Comprehensive signal handler for automatic audit logging.
    
    SIGNAL FLOW:
    1. pre_save: Capture current state before changes
    2. post_save: Compare with new state and log differences
    3. Activity creation: Structured logging with metadata
    4. Statistics update: User productivity metrics
    
    WHAT GETS LOGGED:
    - Status transitions with duration calculations
    - Field changes with before/after values
    - User context (who made the change)
    - Timing information (when, how long in previous state)
    - Automatic vs manual transition detection
    
    JSON SAFETY:
    Uses SafeJSONEncoder to handle UUID serialization
    and other Django model types in the details field.
    """
    
    @classmethod
    def _handle_status_change(cls, instance, user, current_time, previous_status, previous_updated_at):
        """
        Handle status transitions with comprehensive tracking.
        
        DURATION CALCULATION:
        Tracks how long the session was in the previous status.
        This provides valuable analytics about workflow efficiency
        and helps identify bottlenecks in the review process.
        
        TRANSITION CLASSIFICATION:
        - Progression: Normal forward movement through workflow
        - Regression: Backward movement (usually for corrections)
        - Error recovery: Failed → previous working status
        - Error transition: Any status → failed (problems detected)
        
        METADATA COLLECTION:
        - Auto vs manual transition detection
        - User-provided reason (if available)
        - System context (IP address, user agent)
        - Performance metrics (duration, timing)
        """
```

### 5. Security Implementation

#### Permission Decorators
```python
@owns_session
@session_status_required('draft', 'strategy_ready')
@rate_limit(max_requests=60, window=3600)
def secure_view(request, session_id):
    """
    Example of security decorator stacking.
    
    DECORATOR ORDER MATTERS:
    1. @owns_session: Validates user owns the session
       - Loads session into request.session_obj
       - Returns 404 if not owned by user
    
    2. @session_status_required: Validates session status
       - Checks session.status against allowed values
       - Returns 403 if status not permitted for this action
    
    3. @rate_limit: Prevents abuse
       - Tracks requests per user per endpoint
       - Returns 429 if rate limit exceeded
       - Uses sliding window algorithm
    
    AUDIT LOGGING:
    All decorated views automatically log access attempts,
    including successful access and permission violations.
    """
```

#### CSRF Protection Strategy
```python
# Template usage:
{% csrf_token %}  <!-- Always include in forms -->

# AJAX requests:
$.ajaxSetup({
    beforeSend: function(xhr, settings) {
        // Automatically include CSRF token in AJAX requests
        if (!csrfSafeMethod(settings.type) && !this.crossDomain) {
            xhr.setRequestHeader("X-CSRFToken", getCookie('csrftoken'));
        }
    }
});

# API views:
@csrf_protect  # Explicit protection for function views
class SecureAPIView(View):  # Class views inherit CSRF protection
```

### 6. Real-time Features Implementation

#### Status Monitoring System
```python
class StatusMonitor {
    /**
     * Intelligent polling system for real-time status updates.
     * 
     * PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
     * - Visibility-aware: Pauses when page not visible
     * - Adaptive intervals: Faster polling for active sessions
     * - Connection management: Automatic retry with backoff
     * - Minimal queries: Only checks sessions that can change
     * 
     * BUSINESS LOGIC:
     * - Draft sessions don't need monitoring (user-controlled)
     * - Executing/processing sessions checked frequently (30s)
     * - Other statuses checked less frequently (60s)
     * - Failed sessions offer recovery suggestions
     * 
     * USER EXPERIENCE:
     * - Smooth transitions with animations
     * - Progress bars for long-running operations
     * - Notifications for important status changes
     * - Offline detection and graceful degradation
     */
}
```

#### Notification System
```python
class NotificationManager {
    /**
     * Toast notification system with user preferences.
     * 
     * NOTIFICATION TYPES:
     * - success: Positive confirmations (session created)
     * - info: Status updates (search started)
     * - warning: Important notices (approaching limits)
     * - error: Problems needing attention (search failed)
     * 
     * USER CONTROL:
     * - Auto-dismiss timing (1-30 seconds, user configurable)
     * - Sound notifications (optional)
     * - Hover-to-pause (prevents accidental dismissal)
     * - Position preferences (top-right, top-center, etc.)
     * 
     * ACCESSIBILITY:
     * - ARIA live regions for screen readers
     * - High contrast mode support
     * - Keyboard navigation (Tab to focus, Enter to dismiss)
     * - Reduced motion respect (prefers-reduced-motion)
     */
}
```

### 7. Performance Patterns

#### Database Query Optimization
```python
# GOOD: Efficient dashboard query
sessions = SearchSession.objects.filter(
    created_by=request.user  # Ownership filter
).select_related(
    'created_by'  # Prevent N+1 for user data
).prefetch_related(
    'activities'  # Efficient activity loading
).annotate(
    activity_count=Count('activities')  # Database-level counting
).order_by(
    status_priority_case()  # Database-level sorting
)[:12]  # Limit to page size

# BAD: Inefficient pattern that causes N+1 queries
sessions = SearchSession.objects.filter(created_by=request.user)
for session in sessions:
    # This executes a separate query for each session
    activity_count = session.activities.count()
    last_activity = session.activities.first()
```

#### Caching Strategy
```python
from django.core.cache import cache

def get_user_dashboard_stats(user):
    """
    Cache expensive statistical calculations.
    
    CACHE KEY STRATEGY:
    - Include user ID for isolation
    - Include timestamp for invalidation
    - Use consistent naming convention
    
    INVALIDATION:
    - Manual invalidation on session changes
    - TTL as backup (5 minutes for stats)
    - Version-based invalidation for schema changes
    """
    cache_key = f"dashboard_stats_{user.id}_{timezone.now().hour}"
    stats = cache.get(cache_key)
    
    if stats is None:
        stats = calculate_expensive_stats(user)
        cache.set(cache_key, stats, 300)  # 5 minutes
    
    return stats
```

### 8. Error Handling Patterns

#### Graceful Degradation
```python
class ErrorRecoveryManager:
    """
    Context-aware error recovery system.
    
    ERROR CLASSIFICATION:
    - Transient: Network timeouts, temporary service issues
    - Permanent: Configuration errors, invalid data
    - User: Permission issues, invalid operations
    - System: Database failures, external service outages
    
    RECOVERY STRATEGIES:
    - Retry with exponential backoff (transient errors)
    - Reset to previous known good state (permanent errors)
    - User guidance for fixable issues (user errors)
    - Graceful degradation for system errors
    
    USER COMMUNICATION:
    - Clear error messages without technical jargon
    - Specific recovery instructions when possible
    - Progress indication for automatic recovery
    - Escalation path for unrecoverable errors
    """
    
    @classmethod
    def suggest_recovery_actions(cls, session, error_type):
        """
        Generate context-appropriate recovery suggestions.
        
        PERSONALIZATION:
        - Consider user's technical level
        - Account for session's specific state
        - Provide multiple options when possible
        - Include time estimates for recovery actions
        """
```

### 9. Testing Patterns

#### Comprehensive Test Coverage
```python
class AdvancedFormValidationTests(TestCase):
    """
    Security-focused testing with comprehensive edge cases.
    
    BOUNDARY VALUE TESTING:
    - Test exact limits (200 chars for title, 1000 for description)
    - Test just over limits (201 chars, 1001 chars)
    - Test empty values and whitespace-only inputs
    
    SECURITY TESTING:
    - XSS prevention (script tags, malicious HTML)
    - SQL injection prevention (special characters)
    - CSRF protection validation
    - Unicode and emoji handling
    
    PERFORMANCE TESTING:
    - Form validation speed with large datasets
    - Memory usage with many concurrent forms
    - Database query efficiency under load
    
    INTEGRATION TESTING:
    - Multi-step workflow completion
    - Error recovery scenarios
    - Concurrent user interactions
    """
```

### 10. Integration Patterns

#### Future App Compatibility
```python
def safe_reverse(url_name, kwargs=None, fallback_url=None):
    """
    Safe URL reversal for future app integration.
    
    PROBLEM SOLVED:
    During development, not all apps exist yet. Direct calls
    to reverse() will raise NoReverseMatch for missing apps.
    
    SOLUTION:
    Try to reverse the URL, but fall back gracefully if the
    app/view doesn't exist yet. This allows the review_manager
    to be developed independently while preparing for integration.
    
    USAGE:
    - Navigation links to future apps
    - Form action URLs
    - Redirect destinations
    - API endpoint references
    """
    try:
        return reverse(url_name, kwargs=kwargs or {})
    except NoReverseMatch:
        return fallback_url or reverse('review_manager:dashboard')
```
