## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Session not found" error
**Cause**: Trying to access a session you don't own  
**Solution**: Check URL, verify session ID, contact session owner  

#### Session stuck in "Executing" status
**Cause**: Long-running search or system issue  
**Solution**: Wait 30+ minutes, check system status, contact support  

#### Can't edit session title
**Cause**: Session has progressed beyond "Strategy Ready" status  
**Solution**: This is by design for data integrity - create new session if needed  

#### Real-time updates not working
**Cause**: JavaScript disabled or network connectivity issues  
**Solution**: Enable JavaScript, check internet connection, refresh page  

#### Export download fails
**Cause**: Large dataset or temporary server issue  
**Solution**: Try again in a few minutes, contact support for large exports  

### Error Recovery

#### Failed Sessions
1. **View error details**: Click on failed session
2. **Check suggested solutions**: Review recovery options
3. **Try automatic recovery**: Use "Retry" button if available
4. **Reset if needed**: Return to previous working status
5. **Contact support**: If recovery options don't work

#### Data Recovery
1. **Check activity timeline**: See what actions were completed
2. **Export available data**: Download partial results if possible
