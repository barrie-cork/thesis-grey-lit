## Next Steps

1. **Sprint 4**: Implement remaining CRUD operations and detail views
2. **Integration**: Connect with search_strategy app when available
3. **Testing**: Run comprehensive test suite
4. **Deployment**: Prepare for staging environment

## Usage Instructions

### Development Setup
1. Ensure Django 4.2 environment is configured
2. Run migrations: `python manage.py makemigrations review_manager && python manage.py migrate`
3. Create test data: `python manage.py create_sample_sessions --count 15`
4. Start development server: `python manage.py runserver`
5. Navigate to `/review/` to see the dashboard

### Testing
```bash
python manage.py test apps.review_manager
```

### Features to Test
1. Dashboard loading with various session counts
2. Search and filtering functionality
3. Session creation workflow
4. Smart navigation between statuses
5. Responsive design on different screen sizes
6. User permission enforcement
7. AJAX-powered archiving
8. Session duplication

## Architecture Notes

The implementation follows Django best practices and the project's architectural principles:

- **Modular Design**: Each feature is self-contained within the review_manager app
- **Future-Proof**: Phase 2 collaboration fields are included but unused
- **Performance-Focused**: Database queries are optimized with proper indexing
- **User-Centric**: Every feature is designed around user acceptance criteria
- **Accessible**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout
- **Maintainable**: Clean code with comprehensive documentation and tests

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the remaining Sprint 4-11 tasks and ensures the Review Manager app meets all Phase 1 requirements while preparing for Phase 2 expansion.
